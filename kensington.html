								<h2>About Kensington New York City Local SEO</h2>
								
								<!-- About us Content -->
								<p>NAP is used by local search engines, i.e. Name, Address, and Phone Number- as a measure for consistency and accuracy in validating local businesses. It is critical to ensure that even the tiniest piece of data provided here aligns perfectly. As a business, you must ensure that even the most seemingly insignificant error does not harm your citation.</p>

<p>For example, if you're running "Bowie's Confectionery" and registering (in local directories) as "Bowies' Confectionery," your registration is incorrect. Your NAP is what sets your company apart from the competition. You can only image how many confectioneries there in your neighborhood. The majority of them understand the significance of local SEO. As a result, they are also registering in directories. Your company's genuine identity is defined by its name, address, and phone number, which often allows prospects to distinguish your company from others. So you can't afford to make a mistake there.</p>

<p>It is critical that your NAP is consistent across all local directories. Separate names, addresses, and phone numbers have no place in different directories. You should enter the correct name, address, and phone number into the first directory and keep it consistent across all directories. In local citation, there is no space for mistakes in spelling, numbers, or even single alphabets. This is something that the Local SEO Company you hire should be aware of.</p>

<p>Keeping the "Musts" in mind. Make sure you're familiar with the fundamental laws of NAP: Google and other search engines should be able to crawl your citationâ€”it should be search engine readable.
As previously stated, the citation must be consistent with Google Places pages and other citations. Minor formatting inconsistencies, such as "Ave" for "Avenue," should not affect you too much.
The data can be included anywhere on your pages or in your code. It can also be added to your sidebar widget or footer area. However, other experts believe that it should not be included in the title or description because doing so would be a waste of space. If you conduct business from many locations, you can list all of your NAPs on each page. Having the same landing page for many NAPs is usually not a problem.
You can style it with CSS or have it in a single line.
Make sure the blob appears no more than 2 or 3 times (maximum) on the same page, and never more than 8 or 9 times.</p>

<p>More on that later. Ask any SEO professional and he or she will tell you how he or she may go on to write pages on the value of Name, Address, and Phone Number in terms of Local SEO. We hope that we have provided you with enough information to be properly guided regarding its correct and best utilization.</p>
